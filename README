# cubesolver
3x3 Cube Solver - Create sequence to solve with a corners first method with Java, display a 2-D GUI.

Nathen St. Germain

Using a corners first method, allow user to input their current 3x3 cube scramble and give them a sequence to solve it. Use
a 2-D graphical user interface to display each side of the cube as moves are happening.  Define the realtive position of the 
cube so the user can follow easy.

Programmed in Java.

Features to implement to project:
